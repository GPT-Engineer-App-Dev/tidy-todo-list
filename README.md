# tidy-todo-list

Implement a basic todo app with the following features:

- Input field to add new tasks
- List of tasks with checkboxes to mark them as complete
- Button to remove completed tasks
- Use Chakra UI components for styling

For now, the tasks should only persist in memory (no need for backend/database).
